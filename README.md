# Analysis of US Accidents
Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.


## Introduction
This project involves the analysis of a US accident dataset using Python. The dataset contains information about accidents in the US up to December 2020. The primary tool used for data manipulation and analysis is `pandas`, a powerful data analysis library.

## Steps Involved

### 1. Importing Libraries
We begin by importing necessary libraries, including `pandas`, which provides high-level data structures and functions to efficiently handle large datasets.

### 2. Loading the Dataset
The dataset is loaded using `pd.read_csv()`, which reads the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame. This data contains multiple columns representing various features of US accidents, such as location, time, and weather conditions.

### 3. Exploring the Data
- We inspect the first few rows of the data using `df.head(10)` to get a preview of the dataset.
- We examine the columns using `df.columns` and check the size of the dataset by printing the number of rows and columns.

### 4. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Preprocessing steps ensure the data is clean and ready for analysis:
- **Handling Missing Data**: Missing values are handled by either removing them or filling them with appropriate values.
- **Data Types**: We ensure that the columns have the correct data types for proper analysis (e.g., numerical, categorical, or date-time formats).

### 5. Descriptive Statistics
- We compute summary statistics such as mean, median, and mode for numerical columns.
- For categorical data, we calculate counts and percentages to understand the distribution of data.
- Visualizations such as histograms and bar charts are generated to visualize the data distribution.

### 6. Data Visualization
We use libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to visualize the data:
- **Accident Trends**: Plots showing accident frequency over time or across different states help in understanding accident patterns.
- **Geospatial Plots**: Maps displaying accident hotspots across the US help in identifying regions with higher accident rates.

### 7. Feature Engineering
New variables are created from the existing data:
- **Accident Severity**: We categorize accidents based on severity levels, weather conditions, and road types to better understand contributing factors.

### 8. Conclusion
The project concludes by summarizing the key insights from the analysis:
- Identification of factors that correlate with accidents.
- Recognition of states or regions with higher accident rates.
- Suggestions for further analysis or improvements in data quality for more robust results.
